# VoidBot

This is a bot which handles notifications to our IRC channel.  It
allows us to replicate functionality that GitHub previously had built
in but removed some time ago.  You probably shouldn't fork this unless
you're fixing a specific complaint addressed in channel, as the code
quality is pretty poor, and the bot is not in any way extensible.
